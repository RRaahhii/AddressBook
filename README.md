This is my Python based project! It's not supposed to be a sophisticated and complex script with multiple imports and JSON files, etc. The whole point is to practice my Python basics and to see what I can come up with without any imports from other libraries. This "AddressBook" personal project has essentially everything that is elementary to Python, such as elifs, formatted strings, dictionaries, etc. When you run this code, it'll save the strings into the empty dictionary and be able to be retrievable at any time. There will be multiple prompts for you to choose from, and you just choose which one you'd like to do.
